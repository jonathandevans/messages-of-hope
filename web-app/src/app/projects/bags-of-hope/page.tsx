        <p>Bags of Hope is a project to give items to patients arriving on psychiatric wards. Our goal is to ensure that nobody arrives to psychiatric wards with only the clothes on their back. Patients should be there for treatment and help, and hospital admissions shouldn't feel like a prison sentence.</p>
        <p>These Bags of Hope provide essential items such as body wash, wipes, socks, and underwear, offering comfort and dignity to patients during a challenging time. Donated items are sorted into different bags, each providing a range of essentials as well as activites, snacks.</p>
        <p>The bags are delivered to local psychiatric wards in and around the Vale of Glamorgan.</p>
