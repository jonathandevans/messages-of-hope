        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track (&apos;DNT&apos;) feature or
          setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
          data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
          this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and
          implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not
          currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
          automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
          standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
          future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
          this privacy notice.
