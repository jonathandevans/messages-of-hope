            Messages of Hope is a Community Interest Company encouraging people
            to write hopeful messages for those struggling with mental health.
            We organise a range of projects each year, each designed to connect
            communities through creativity and collective empathy. Our
            initiatives include collaborative art pieces, video projects for
            mental health awareness days, and public displays of messages of
            hope.
