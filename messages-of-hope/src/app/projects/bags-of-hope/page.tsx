          Bags of Hope is a project to give items to patients arriving on
          psychiatric wards. Our goal is to ensure that nobody arrives to
          psychiatric wards with only the clothes on their back. Patients should
          be there for treatment and help, and hospital admissions shouldn't
          feel like a prison sentence.
        </p>
        <p>
          These Bags of Hope provide essential items such as body wash, wipes,
          socks, and underwear, offering comfort and dignity to patients during
          a challenging time. Donated items are sorted into different bags, each
          providing a range of essentials as well as activites, snacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bags are delivered to local psychiatric wards in and around the
          Vale of Glamorgan.
