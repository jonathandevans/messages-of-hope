# Navigation Bar

**Location: _src/components/navbar.tsx_**

The navbar component is used to display the logo and the navigation links. When the user has a small screen, the navigation links are hidden behind a hamburger menu. The navbar component is used on all pages of the application.

The navbar component is designed to be used in combination with the [Banner](/docs/components/banner.md) component. This is because the navbar by default has no background colour, and the text is white to provide some contrast, and the banner component is used to provide a background image for the navbar.

## Props

The navbar component does not take any props.
